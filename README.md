# Discord-API-Token-Entrance

## Description

- This is a Token Manager that allows your token to enter your discord server, written in python.

## Packages Required

- compiler (vsc, python idle-shell works)
- python
- zip extractor (winrar works perfectly)

## How To Use

- Install this project to your desktop
- Extract it using your zip extraction tools
- Open your IDLE Shell, make a new project inside of it
- Paste the code you downloaded
- Edit it to your preference (paste discord link + token/s)
- Compile.

# Notes

- We do not take any responsibility for anything happening.
- You might get suspended.
- Contact Janipalen#1000 for errors.
- If you're pasting multiple tokens, this is a one time use, after the token has joined your server it'll get a warning from discord so do this once!

# How To Edit
```py
# You'll see a "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE" in 7th line. Paste your token/s there.
# Paste the last characters from your discord invite in the "PASTE_LINK_HERE" part of the 16th line.
```
